# 🛠️ SQL Interview Prep – StrataScratch Solutions

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my **SQL solutions** to problems from **StrataScratch**, focusing on an **interview-style problem-solving approach**. The goal is not just to solve queries but to **understand SQL deeply**, develop structured thinking, and help others by sharing insights.

I will be **uploading solutions regularly**, aiming to solve **3 SQL problems per day**. Each solution includes:
- **Understanding the problem**: What the query is trying to achieve.
- **Key questions to ask**: Edge cases and constraints to consider.
- **Step-by-step approach**: Thought process before writing the query.
- **Optimized SQL solution**: Best practices for performance and readability.

## 🏆 Why I’m Doing This
- To **strengthen** my ability to write efficient SQL queries for real-world scenarios.
- To **prepare** for SQL-based technical interviews and case studies.
- To **help others** by sharing solutions and alternative approaches.

Each file contains:
- **Problem statement**
- **Approach & explanation**
- **SQL query solution**
- **Alternative approaches (if applicable)**
- **Performance considerations**
